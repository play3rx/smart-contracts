## Getting Started with API3

This repo contains some basic contracts and scripts to get started with using and integrating API3's first-party oracles. This repo contains guides for:

- [QRNG](https://docs.api3.org/reference/qrng/)

- [Airnode](https://docs.api3.org/reference/airnode/latest/understand/)

- [dAPIs](https://docs.api3.org/reference/dapis/understand/)

## Installation and Setup

Clone the repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/api3-ecosystem/getting-started.git && cd getting-started
```

To install all the dependencies, run the following command:
```shell
yarn
```

- Make `credentials.json` and add your mnemonic for the network/s you will work with. This wallet needs to be funded to cover the gas costs to deploy/use the contracts.

```bash
$ cp credentials.example.json credentials.json
```

## Making a request to the SportMonks F1 Airnode

For the Hackathon, we've integrated and deployed an Airnode for [SportMonks F1 API](https://docs.sportmonks.com/formula-one/) on Goerli Testnet. The following steps are used to deploy a requester that calls the [GET Track Winners by Season ID](https://docs.sportmonks.com/formula-one/our-api/winners/get-track-winners-by-season-id) endpoint.

#### 1. Setup
Please follow the setup instructions [here](#installation-and-setup) before going to step 2

#### 2. Deploy the Requester contract
run the following command to deply a requester contract

```
yarn deploy-rrp-requester
```

this will deploy the RrpRequester contract. You can use this contract as a template to make calls to the sportsmonk API.

Once you run the command note down the RrpRequester address

#### 3. Deriving the sponsorWallet and funding it

The `sponsorWallet` covers the gas costs for the fulfillment of the request, so we need to derive and fund it. Run the following command to derive the sponsorWallet making sure that you replaced `<YOUR-REQUESTER_CONTRACT-ADDRESS>` with the RrpRequester address you deployed in step 3

```
npx @api3/airnode-admin derive-sponsor-wallet-address \
  --airnode-xpub xpub6C9hFCLsUsU1dPMDaf5cDKiFwxUsET6zmAHxqLWaUBW2jJejjW2GpAxMY4HAeHkBGxeu9hdSyDoLJM7R23jGTfYekWjMcLvtvzrKszarDGY \
  --airnode-address 0xB0B2C57c67aB89c3c65480C4aDE37b66d418c68e \
  --sponsor-address <YOUR-REQUESTER_CONTRACT-ADDRESS>
```
- You now need to fund the outputted `sponsorWallet` with some Goerli ETH (around 0.2) for the Airnode to be able to fulfill the request.

#### 4. Making the Request

- To make a request to an Airnode, you'll have to update `script/request_rrp.js` with your `airnodeAddress`, `endpointId` and `encodedParameters`.

The airnode address will always be `0xB0B2C57c67aB89c3c65480C4aDE37b66d418c68e`

For the [GET Track Winners by Season ID](https://docs.sportmonks.com/formula-one/our-api/winners/get-track-winners-by-season-id) endpoint, the endpointId is `0x6e58ace4ab94d28da59ec1da675b513cc21a3ca9656228c0b052563a2eb88b3e`

You'll have to encode your API parameters using `@api3/airnode-abi` and pass them to the `makeRequest` function of the Airnode.

For example, the the [GET Track Winners by Season ID](https://docs.sportmonks.com/formula-one/our-api/winners/get-track-winners-by-season-id) endpoint takes in a `seasonId` as a parameter. You would also have to specify the `_path` of the returned json object that needs to be picked up by the Airnode and `_type` specifies the datatype of the returned object.



```
const params = [
      {type: 'string', name: 'seasonID', value: '6'}, 
      { type: 'string', name: '_path', value: 'data.0.id' }, 
      { type: 'string', name: '_type', value: 'int256' }
    ];
```

the following params are then encoded in the [`/scripts/request_rrp.js`](https://github.com/api3-ecosystem/getting-started/blob/3ba99782013dd98513f0a16db36138da1a6eaeaa/scripts/request_rrp.js#L36) script before being used to make the request to the airnode. If you want to use different parameters or endpointIds you can modify the params object as needed.

run the following command to make the request:
```
yarn request-rrp
```
this will make the request, within 100 seconds the sports monk airnode should reply with the response.

#### 5. Using different endpoints

you can use other endpoints apart from [Track Winners by Season ID](https://docs.sportmonks.com/formula-one/our-api/winners/get-track-winners-by-season-id). Here is a list of endpoints and endpointIds

| endpointId                                                          | endpointName                      |

when choosing a different endpointId make sure to modify the [`/scripts/request_rrp.js`](https://github.com/api3-ecosystem/getting-started/blob/3ba99782013dd98513f0a16db36138da1a6eaeaa/scripts/request_rrp.js) script with the approriate endpointId and params

## QRNG - Quantum Random Number Generator

Please follow the setup instructions [here](#installation-and-setup) before going forward

To request random numbers you first need to deploy a qrng requester contract. run the following command to deploy a qrng requester:
```
yarn deploy-qrng-requester
```

To use the QRNG services, you'll first have to fund the `sponsorWallet` that will cover the gas cost of the fulfillment of the request. To read more about how QRNG works, [click here](https://docs.api3.org/guides/qrng/). To fund your `sponsorWallet`, run:

```shell
yarn fund-qrng
```

To request a single random number from the QRNG Airnode:
    
```shell
yarn request-qrng:uint256
```

To request an array of random numbers:

```shell
yarn request-qrng:array
```

## API3 dAPIs - Price feeds

Please follow the setup instructions [here](#installation-and-setup) before going forward

Run the following command to deploy a dAPI price reader:
```shell
yarn deploy-dapi-reader
```

Check out [this guide](https://docs.api3.org/guides/dapis/subscribing-self-funded-dapis/) to learn how to subscribe to self-funded dAPIs.
 To read the price of an asset from the API3 dAPIs, make sure to set your proxy address during deployment and run:

```shell
yarn read-dapi
```

You can also check [this guide](https://docs.api3.org/guides/dapis/read-a-dapi/) on how to read from a dAPI Proxy.
